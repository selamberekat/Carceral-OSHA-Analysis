## About - Carceral Ecology
This repository aims to document the Carceral Ecology project, that is being developed by Professor Nicholas Shapiro, UCLA, and Professor Lindsay Poirier, UCD. 

Incarcerated people are on the frontlines of environmental injustice. This systematic exposure of, at a minimum, tens of thousands of incarcerated individuals results from mass incarceration’s close ties with declining, but very much ongoing, industrialism. Often built atop the brownfields of former manufacturing facilities or mines or on the cheap land next to operating facilities, prisons serve as a “recession-proof” employer to those laid off in deindustrialization beginning in the 1970s. This project seeks to assess the environmental hazards of mass incarceration on a national scale. 

This project has three main arms:
1. Envrionmental monitoring
2. Iterative study design with stakeholders
3. Data analysis of datasets that may cast light on the environmental conditions of prisons, jail, and detention centers. 

It is the third component that has likely led you here. We are managing our work flow through the [issues](https://github.com/Carceral-Ecologies/Carceral-ECHO-data/issues) function. Thats probably the best place to start contributing. 

## About - The OSHA Project

This portion of the project is working on component three above, specifically analyzing data from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to cast light on conditions within prisons, jails, and other carceral facilities.  

This work is in progress.
